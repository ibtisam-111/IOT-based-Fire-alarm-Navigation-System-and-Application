# IOT-based-Fire-alarm-Navigation-System-and-Application
In Past few years, fire alarm systems have increasingly become sophisticated and functionally more capable and reliable. The two main objectives are the protection of life and property. As a result of state and local codes, fire protection has become more and more concerned with life safety over the past two decades. There have been several safety measures implemented to address the problems caused by the fires and reduce the number of fatalities and property damage. Our project is to develop a fire alarm navigation system that uses the Internet of Things. Fire alarm systems are designed to warn people about fires in advance so that they can evacuate the fire-affected area and take immediate action to control the fire. There will be a GPS module, a flame sensor, a smoke sensor, buzzers, leds, and a GSM module to ensure early notification to authorities and fire stations. The aim is to reduce the loss of lives and property.
